								  <p>We celebrate an iconic Cornelia Webb style that was launched 10 years ago and still is one of our very best sellers - Folded Cuff. <br>

SS20 is a hommage to lasting style, jewellery does not have to be part of the fast fashion that is strongly connected with the fashion industry. A piece of jewellery can be just as relevant today as it was 10 years ago when it was first made.  <br>

Folded cuff was created in an era of a dominant graphic trend in jewellery, while Cornelia wanted to lift a soft and feminine side that would still earn it’s place and make it’s way in an often hard and masculine world. Something we feel is still as important now, as it was then.<br>

Folded Cuff gives the illusion of liquid metal, like the sensation of a flowing fabric.  <br>
Cornelia looked further on from the inspiration of the human anatomy and nature and let structure lead completely. The original forms was created by hand in silver clay that was played with and folded with, the same way as you work with ceramic and clay sculptures. <br>

The development into an entire collection based on Folded Cuff has been crafted mainly in Italy, where the forms have been kneaded by hand and then combined with elegant pavé stone setting on chosen pieces.<br>

In main collection we have also included a tight story of corals, a continuation from past seasons and it was again relevant, because we don’t feel we can rest on putting a light on what the destruction of the coral reefs mean to planet earth. The corals have, in the world as well in our collection, gone from being colourful, to white, to grey. It is time to speed up the re-construction of our reefs.
The coral collection comes in recycled brass with degradable bio-resin. <br>

In 2019, we contributed to Bio-Rock with 1% of our total revenue towards re-building and preserving coral reefs in Bali, where we have major part of our production.<br> 

To reach a more sustainable business model Cornelia Webb has, apart from our use of recycled materials and eco-friendly packaging, chosen to reduce the size of the seasonal collections to mark a resistance against the fast pace of the business and take another evident step towards a more long-term view on the evolution of jewellery. In the same way we work with protecting the environment we also need to apply a care package for ourselves, our creativity, our staff and our partners. We also wear out.<br><br>

Materials<br><br>

Recycled Sterling silver - our factory in Italy perform this process on site themselves.<br>

E-coated brass, 90% of the brass production worldwide is actually re-used zink and copper. The brass industry depends on the recycling of brass scrap for its survival. Making brass from new copper and zinc would be uneconomical and wasteful of raw materials, so since new brass articles are almost entirely made from recycled scrap, brass is a sustainable choice.<br>

Bio-resin, meaning it is naturally degradable. A bio-resin is a resin that derives some or all of its constituent monomers from biological sources. Today's sources are plant-based, usually corn or soybean by-products from bio-diesel fuel refinement. Other candidates include sugar cane, sugar beets, potatoes, lignocellulose, whey and algae.<br>

When your jewellery arrive, we include our Boston ECO boxes in the delivery. They are made from FSC® certified black cardboard and water based glue. Production in Denmark ensures that carbon dioxide emissions are kept to a minimum as the boxes do not need to be transported long distance to Denmark.<br>

The FSC® mark is your guarantee that the material used comes from an FSC® forest where no other wood falls from what the forest can reproduce. It also means that the animal and plant life in the forests concerned is protected, just as the forest workers are trained, have the right safety equipment and receive a fair salary.<br>

Sponsor Project for 2019-2020. <br><br>

Through the 1% for the Planet foundation we have committed to donate 1% of our total revenue. 1% for the Planet was founded in 2002 by Yvon Chouinard and Craig Mathews. Yvon Chouinard is the founder of the Patagonia Clothing company and Craig Mathews is the founder of Blue Ribbon Flies. The organisation now claims over 1200 members in 48 countries.<br>

In 2020, our chosen project is Green School Bali, who are educating for sustainability in a natural environment.<br>

https://www.greenschool.org/about/ <br>

Green school was started by John hardy who had been producing jewellery in Bali long-term. When he left his company he and his wife started Green School to get sustainability in children’s mindset from an young age.<br>

At Cornelia Webb, we also believe that the big change comes with our children, by learning early on how to live in harmony with nature.<br>

Repurposing, reusing, or recycling materials is some of the best ways we can reduce waste. By doing so, you contribute to making our world a better place. If we all do something small, those small things multiplied by thousands or even millions add up to something big.<br>
